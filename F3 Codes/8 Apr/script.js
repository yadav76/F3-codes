// Above calling is called as CallBack Hell. Other way of calling all function by simplly calling them one by one but it normal calling Developers life is easy but User will fash some difficullty because if one function is not called or a function need to call again then whole code flow is disturbed.

// So maintain code flow we use CallBack Hell
